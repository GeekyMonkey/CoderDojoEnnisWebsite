# Project Context

## Purpose
CoderDojo Ennis Website is a modern, maintainable platform for managing CoderDojo club activities, attendance, member data, and public information. It aims to provide a secure, scalable, and user-friendly experience for club members, mentors, and parents, with robust integration to external services.

## Tech Stack
- Nuxt 4 (Vue 3)
- TypeScript
- Supabase (database & auth)
- Cloudflare Workers (serverless backend)
- Vitest (testing)
- pnpm (package management)
- Static HTML (for legacy/public pages)
- TailwindCSS (used sparingly, only in reusable components)

## Project Conventions

### Code Style
Use TypeScript for all new code.
Vue/Nuxt components for all features (unless static HTML is required).
TailwindCSS used sparingly, only in reusable components.
Prefer reusable CSS style classes over Tailwind or inline styles.
Clean, well-documented code; avoid duplication.
Semantic versioning for releases.
Linting and formatting enforced before merge.

### Architecture Patterns
Framework-first: All features as Vue/Nuxt components.
Static content in `src/public`.
API contracts and data models defined in backend, shared via TypeScript interfaces.
Configuration and environment variables for service integration.
Observability: Logging and error handling in Nuxt config and backend.

### Testing Strategy
Test-first discipline: Tests written before implementation.
Vitest for all unit/integration tests.
Red-Green-Refactor cycle enforced.
All tests, linting, and formatting must pass before merge.

### Git Workflow
PRs required for all changes; code review and approval mandatory.
Automated deployment on commit to master.
Quality gates: Lint, format, and test checks in CI pipeline.
Public contributions via PR; MIT license.

## Domain Context

Static hosting via Cloudflare Pages.
Automated deployment on master branch commit.
Compliance with public contribution and review standards.

## External Dependencies
Supabase (database, authentication)
Cloudflare Workers (serverless backend)
TailwindCSS (used sparingly, only in reusable components)
