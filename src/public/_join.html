					<h4>Kids</h4>
					<p>
						Kids from 7 up can join. Only very basic reading skills are
						necessary. We’ll be splitting up the kids depending on their
						abilities. Once you’ve mastered one skillset, we’ll move onto a
						tougher one so that you’re always challenged and having fun. We
						don’t want anyone to be bored!
					</p>

					<p>
						Due to large numbers this year, we are making a waiting list for the
						next intake of new kids. Please
						<a
							href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kh7WkqYj6SIjOg4rRgzx9Q-4GTi4Or8ed6dRCUaACzM/viewform?usp=send_form"
							>fill out this form</a
						>
						to be put on the waiting list. When you’ve received an email
						invitation with the start date, you will be asked to fill in a
						registration form and you’ll be added to the member database.
					</p>
				</div>

					<h4>Volunteers</h4>

					<p>
						Got a skill you think the kids would like to learn? We could
						certainly use some help. Email us at enniscoderdojo@gmail.com and
						let us know you’d like to become a mentor. We’re all volunteers
						though, so the only payment is a great feeling of accomplishment.
					</p>

					<p>
						We can also use non-technical volunteers as well for the
						administrative tasks and supervision. Email us at
						enniscoderdojo@gmail.com and let us know that you’d like to get
						involved.
					</p>

					<p>
						If you're interested in volunteering at our club, please
						<a href="https://www.facebook.com/CoderDojoEnnis?ref=ts&fref=ts"
							>send us a message on our Facebook account</a
						>.
